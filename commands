sudo docker run --name website -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d -p 8080:80 nginx - mount host web files to nginx file & override default d=niginx display content

sudo docker exec -it website bash - This is used to cd into the bash directory of a specified container. In out case, website is the name of the container and can be name of anny oter containery

sudo docker run --name website_copy --volumes-from website -d -p 8081:80 nginx  - Here we ran a new container names website_copy and copied volumes from a exsiting container called website and map a new localhost port 8081 to nginx image' port of 80. So we invaraible created a copy of the existing nginx contianer running on port 8080 but now this copy runs on port 8081 since port 8080 is already in use by the container named website
